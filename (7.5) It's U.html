					<p>I guess it's just another one of those nights</p>
					<p>When I'll spend way too much time</p>
					<p>On something so small that no one really cares about at all</p>
					<p>I guess it's just another one of those thoughts</p>
					<p>And I can't really find a cause</p>
					<p>Whether it's all just in my mind or something more here in my life</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's you, it's you</p>
					<p>Oh god, it's you</p>
					<p>It's you</p>
					<p>If you're awake then I am too</p>
					<p>If you're lost then I'll find you</p>
					<p>If you're hurt then I'll fix you</p>
					<p>If you go blind I'll describe the view</p>
					<p>If you can't feel then I'll hold you</p>
					<p>If you fall know I've got you</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>If you fall down too far and I can't see you through these marks</p>
					<p>And your eyes are covered in scars, and my head's filling with tar</p>
					<p>Don't worry we'll find another way out</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>Your silhouette doesn't look quite right</p>
					<p>And I can never find the time</p>
					<p>To bury my hands in words</p>
					<p>I'd grow a new kind of evergreen tree, just for you and me</p>
					<p>On second thoughts, will you even remember me?</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>But it's always been you (It's always been you)</p>
					<p>It's always been you (It's always been you)</p>
					<p>It's always been you (It's always been you)</p>
					<p>It's always been you (It's always been you)</p>
					<p>It's always been you (It's always been you)</p>
					<p>It's always been you</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Is it me for you?</p>

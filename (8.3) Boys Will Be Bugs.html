					<p>I'm a dumb teen boy, I eat sticks and rocks and mud</p>
					<p>I don't care about the government, and I really need a hug</p>
					<p>I feel stupid (Stupid), ugly (Ugly), pretend it doesn't bother me</p>
					<p>I'm not very strong, but I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's getting cold down here underneath the weather</p>
					<p>I skipped class to sit with you, I really like your spotty sweater</p>
					<p>If ladybugs are girls, how do you make kids together?</p>
					<p>What's it like in a female world? I bet it's just so much better</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>I just turned fourteen</p>
					<p>And I think this year I'm gonna be mean</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>Don't mess with me, I'm a big boy now and I'm very scary</p>
					<p>I punch my walls, stay out at night and I do karate</p>
					<p>Don't message me 'cause I won't reply, I wanna make you cry</p>
					<p>Ain't that how it's s'posed to be?</p>
					<p>Though it isn't me, boys will be bugs, right?</p>

					<p>I'm a dumb teen boy, all I wanna do is quit</p>
					<p>My mum told me that she's worried and I couldn't give a shit</p>
					<p>I have friends who understand me, their names are spider, beetle, bee</p>
					<p>They don't say much, but they have always listened to me</p>

					<p>The other boys at school think it's cool to hate your parents</p>
					<p>But they're lyin' all the time, the bugs advised that I should let 'em</p>
					<p>And if you wanna cry, make sure that they never see it</p>
					<p>Or even better yet, block it out and never feel it</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>

					<p>Everyone and everything around me's always changing</p>
					<p>Everyone except me, I'm stayin' the same as if I was nothing</p>
					<p>I don't sing my songs, I bleed them</p>
					<p>I don't write unless I mean them</p>
					<p>Without cold, the snow's just rain</p>
					<p>Without my voice, it's all the same</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's okay, we're just scared</p>
					<p>It's okay, we're just scared (hey)</p>
					<p>It's okay, we're just scared</p>
					<p>It's okay, we're just scared</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>I don't really need to sleep much longer</p>
					<p>But the longer I sleep, the slower my heart beats</p>
					<p>There's fire on my floor telling me to sleep some more</p>
					<p>Cry a little louder if you know what this means</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's okay, we're just scared (it's okay, we're just scared)</p>
					<p>It's okay, we're just scared (it's okay, we're just scared)</p>
					<p>It's okay, we're just scared (it's okay, we're just scared)</p>
					<p>It's okay, we're just scared (it's okay-ay)</p>
					<p>I forgot about the note I left on my back door (on my back door)</p>
					<p>But it's alright</p>
					<p>I'll stay here inside with my friends who aren't here anymore</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>Actually, you know what</p>
					<p>The way things are isn't good enough</p>

					<p>It already feels like October
					<p>They say, "You go with the boys, I'll go with the girls"</p>
					<p>I don't remember much, some colours and a mirror maze</p>
					<p>I think I figured out what it's all for</p>
					<p>I got everything I wanted, but I wanted more</p>
					<p>Take a night bus, board a red-eye to steer your fate</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's my bad, it's my bad, it's my bad, don't lie</p>
					<p>I'll pay it back, pay it back, pay it back sometime</p>
					<p>Don't be mad, don't be mad, don't be mad when I</p>
					<p>Apologise for the very next time</p>
					<p>It's my bad, it's my bad, it's my bad, don't lie</p>
					<p>I'll pay it back, pay it back, pay it back sometime</p>
					<p>I can't relax, can't relax, I'm not built like you</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>You wouldn't let it eat you wholе</p>
					<p>You wouldn't let it eat you whole</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>It's my bad, it's my bad, it's my bad, don't liе</p>
					<p>I'll pay it back, pay it back, pay it back sometime</p>
					<p>Don't be mad, don't be mad, don't be mad when I</p>
					<p>Apologise for the very next time</p>
					<p>It's my bad, it's my bad, it's my bad, don't lie</p>

					<br>
					<p>You wouldn't let it eat you whole</p>
					<p>You wouldn't let it eat you whole</p>
					<p>You wouldn't let it eat you whole</p>
					<p>You wouldn't let it eat you whole</p>
					<p>(You wouldn't let it eat you whole)</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>I had a bad day, that's not a stranger to you</p>
					<p>You cried last night, I don't have nothing to prove</p>
					<p>It wouldn't work well, I wouldn't know what to do</p>
					<p>I couldn't know what to do, I never know what to do</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>Breaking and breaking and breaking again</p>
					<p>Oh, why would you do that? Go sleep with my friend</p>
					<p>Make most of youth, but sometimes it don't bend</p>
					<p>Why'd you pretend?</p>
					<p>Breaking on broken glass, and it's all I can see</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Thinking, I'm thinking, I'm thinking it's all that I need</p>

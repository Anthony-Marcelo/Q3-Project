					<br>
					<p>I can recall, sittin' alone</p>
					<p>The last one left to leave</p>
					<p>So you had asked me if you could walk me home</p>
					<p>And, I can still hear that school bell ring</p>
					<p>And no one else could tell</p>
					<p>My frown was hidden by a grin</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>All those memories we shared</p>
					<p>All the streets we used to roam</p>
					<p>Are the pigments that you painted</p>
					<p>Now my world’s not monochrome</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>Back when we were younger</p>
					<p>And our dreams were unexplored</p>
					<p>We just needed each other</p>
					<p>Couldn't ever ask for more</p>
					<p>Oh, nobody had flaws</p>
					<p>And nothing had a cause</p>
					<p>When we were younger (Mhm)</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>Uh, ah? Mr. Cavetown, how 'bout you? (How ’bout you?)</p>
					<p>This street feels small</p>
					<p>And now I can count on both my hands (5, 6, 7, 8)</p>
					<p>All the times I fell right here, right there</p>
					<p>Scuffed up my knees, screamed, "Mom I'm scared"</p>
					<p>We're trying our best (We're try our best)</p>
					<p>My best isn't good enough these days</p>
					<p>Can we go back? Is it too late? (Is it too late? Are we too late?)</p>
					<p>Wait just a minute, would you slow it down, please?</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>But those memories we shared</p>
					<p>All the streets we used to roam</p>
					<p>All the pigments that you painted</p>
					<p>Now my world's not monochrome</p>

					<p>Oh, nobody had flaws</p>
					<p>And nothing had a cause</p>
					<p>When we were younger (Mhm)</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>Doo-doo, doo-doo</p>
					<p>Doo-doo, doo-doo</p>
					<p>Doo-doo, doo-doo</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>

					<p>When we were younger (Mhm)</p>
					<p>(When we were younger)</p>
					<p>We always wish we could grow faster (We always wished we could grow faster)</p>
					<p>I wish I took my time (I wish I took my time)</p>
					<p>Look at where we are now (Look at where we are now)</p>
					<p>Oh, how the time flies by (Oh, how the time flies by)</p>
					<p>Oh, well</p>
					<p>Now wait just a damn minute</p>
					<p>No one ever said it would be so fast</p>
					<p>This is not what I signed up for</p>

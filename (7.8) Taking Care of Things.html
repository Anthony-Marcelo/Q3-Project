					<p>Where do the boys go when it gets cold out</p>
					<p>Do they have a place to sleep?</p>
					<p>Where did their mums go? Did they get taken</p>
					<p>Or had they had enough of taking care of things?</p>
					<p>It's hard to say if someone's at fault</p>
					<p>If I don't do anything is it my fault?</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>Where do the girls go when they feel frightened</p>
					<p>Do they have something to eat?</p>
					<p>Where did their dads go? Did they get taken</p>
					<p>Or had they had enough of taking care of things?</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>I've gotta find a way to make this feel okay</p>
					<p>When rock bottom for me is routine for someone else</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>I'm gonna take care of things</p>
					<p>There's things I need to sort out</p>
					<p>I'm gonna take care of things</p>
					<p>Cause they're not where I want them right now</p>
					<p>I know there's good in everything</p>
					<p>And it'll show itself when you're gentle to it</p>
					<p>I'm gonna take care of things</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>Where does my mind go when it gets stupid?</p>
					<p>Is there anyone in there?</p>
					<p>Where did my friends go? Did they get taken</p>
					<p>Or had they had enough of going to therapy?</p>
					<p>Sat in a cold room, The corners feel friendly</p>
					<p>I think they'll take care of me</p>
					<p>My brothers are circles, My sisters quadrilaterals</p>
					<p>And they're all so pretty</p>
					<br>
					<p>♪</p>
					<br>
					<p>I'm gonna take care of things</p>
					<p>There's things I need to sort out</p>
					<p>I'm gonna take care of things</p>
					<p>They're not where I need them right now</p>
